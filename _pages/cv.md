## Projects

### Memory-Augmented Semantic Segmentation

* Designed UNet-based segmentation model with global latent memory improving mIoU over DeepLab baseline
* Implemented cross-attention conditioning between pixel features and global slots
* Optimized training pipeline (mixed precision + caching) reducing training time by 35%

### Vision Model Failure Analysis Framework

* Benchmarked segmentation models and categorized error patterns (boundary, occlusion, small-object)
* Built automated evaluation dashboards for debugging
* Identified dataset bias and improved training strategy

### AI Document Verification System

* Built OCR → feature extraction → fraud classification pipeline
* Implemented REST API and asynchronous job processing
* Reduced false positives using hybrid rule-based + ML validation

### Retrieval-Augmented Chatbot

* Implemented semantic retrieval with vector database search
* Reduced hallucinations via grounded response generation
* Added multi-user sessions and caching for latency improvement
