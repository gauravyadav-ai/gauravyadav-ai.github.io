Hi, I’m **Gaurav Yadav** — a Data Scientist focused on understanding how machine learning models actually behave, not just how to train them.

My work primarily revolves around **Deep Learning, Computer Vision, and model reliability**. I am particularly interested in analyzing failure patterns in neural networks and designing architectures that improve robustness and contextual understanding.

I have worked on segmentation models where I studied *why models fail* rather than only improving accuracy. This led me to design a **memory-augmented neural network** that conditions pixel predictions on global latent context, outperforming a standard DeepLab baseline.

My research interests include:

• Computer Vision
• Representation Learning
• Attention Mechanisms
• Model Interpretability
• Failure Analysis of Neural Networks
• Robust Deep Learning Systems

## Skills

**Languages:** Python
**Frameworks:** PyTorch, NumPy
**Concepts:** Deep Learning, CNNs, Attention, Optimization, Statistics

---

## Goal

I aim to build machine learning systems that are not only accurate, but *understandable and reliable*. My long-term interest lies in research roles combining deep learning with real-world decision systems.
