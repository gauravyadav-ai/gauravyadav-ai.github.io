Hi, I am **Gaurav Yadav**, a Data Scientist interested in understanding how machine learning models behave, not just how to train them.

My work focuses on Deep Learning, Computer Vision, and model reliability. I study failure patterns in neural networks and design architectures that improve contextual understanding.

I worked on semantic segmentation models where I analyzed why models fail instead of only improving accuracy. This led to a memory-augmented neural network that conditions pixel predictions on global latent context and outperformed a standard DeepLab baseline.

## Research Interests

* Computer Vision
* Representation Learning
* Attention Mechanisms
* Model Interpretability
* Failure Analysis of Neural Networks
* Robust Deep Learning Systems

## Current Work

* Failure analysis of semantic segmentation networks
* Global context modeling using slot-based memory architectures
* Improving pixel-level predictions using latent conditioning

## Skills

Languages: Python
Frameworks: PyTorch, NumPy
Concepts: Deep Learning, CNNs, Attention, Optimization, Statistics

## Goal

I want to build machine learning systems that are accurate, understandable, and reliable.
